üîπ Challenges Faced & Solutions

Dynamic Boarding/Dropping Times

Issue: Updating expired bus schedules and ensuring correct Indian time.

Solution: Node Cron runs every hour to update expired bus times to the next day, maintaining boarding and dropping times correctly.

Segment-wise Seat Booking

Issue: Multiple users booking seats for different segments of the same bus route.

Solution: Each seat keeps a record of bookings per segment; Node Cron frees expired segment seats automatically.

Multi-Filter Search API

Issue: Filtering buses by category, amenities, AC/Non-AC, and other criteria.

Solution: Built a robust query system in Node.js, dynamically filtering buses with future availability.

PDF Ticket & Email Automation

Issue: Generate tickets and send them automatically after payment.

Solution: Integrated PDF generation with NodeMailer and triggered email after successful Stripe payment.

Time Zone Management

Issue: MongoDB showed UTC times, causing discrepancies in Indian Standard Time.

Solution: Converted all date-time handling to IST, ensuring accurate schedule display.

Front-End UI Challenges

Issue: Replicating RedBus responsive UI with seat map, step navigation, and animations.

Solution: Used Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI components, Framer Motion, and AOS for smooth animations and fully responsive design.
